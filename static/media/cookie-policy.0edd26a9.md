Our [Privacy Policy](https://videosurveillance.webcam/privacy-policy) explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.
This Cookie Policy is adapted from Cookie Policy of [WordPress](https://automattic.com), which is under a [Creative Commons Sharealike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, which is also this Cookie Policy license under.


### What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as "first party cookies"), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ("third party cookies").

Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

### What is web storage?

The HTML Web Storage is a new technology providing mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs. There are two types, "Session Storage" maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores), "Local Storage" does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened. You may erase them by clearing browsing data in your browser. In this policy, we refer to all of these technologies that stores data on your device as "cookies."

### **How we use cookies**

We use cookies only for Analytics and Performance purpose. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the "Okay" or "Agree" button, for example).
